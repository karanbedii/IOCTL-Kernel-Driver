# IOCTL-Kernel-Driver
Kernel Driver which can be used to read guarded regions, read/write/ protect/ or allocate memory in desired process!

Cons:

  Driver is not signed, but you can find one easily by googling the internet for a leaked EV/OV cert. Cannot load drivers using "sc create" command. You must make your own mapper/ use KDmapper/ Lenovo Mapper to load the driver.
  
  BTW:

  For game hacking, IOCTL is really shitty on the newer anti-cheats; you will get clapped.
